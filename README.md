## Installation

Add this to your zshrc or bash_profile

```bash
alias run=./run
alias shlib-install='bash <(curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlTavares/shlib/main/install?$(date +%s)")'
```

Open a new terminal tab and run

```bash
shlib-install
```

This is pretty much for personal use, so if you found this for any reason, you can use it, but I'm not responsible for any damage it may cause.
